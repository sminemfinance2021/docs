## Risks

It is important for users to understand that the SMIN governance organization, which the team will hold majority control of until the initial distribution is complete, has the ability to change the proxy implementation for most core contracts in the Indexed protocol. All governance transactions are subject to a two day time lock, so careful users should monitor proposals submitted to the governor contract.

## Warning

This project is still in beta and we advise caution - please do not put more into our contracts than you are prepared to lose if a vulnerability is found and exploited.

We are confident in the security of our contracts and have sought third-party opinions, but since the project is new and has not received extensive scrutiny from hackers or auditing firms, we can not be absolutely certain that no mistakes were overlooked.
